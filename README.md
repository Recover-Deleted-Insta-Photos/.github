# How to recover deleted photos on Instagram: Step by Step

Instagram is much more than a social media platform; it's almost an online photo album where memories of everything regarding personal events are kept safe in the form of pictures and videos. Losing such valuable pictures often causes irreversible damage to them, especially if they had sentimental or professional importance. Thankfully, there are ways to **recover deleted Instagram photos** and stop further loss.

The following tutorial is going to show the recovery of lost photographs using all available methods, including feature integrations, third-party applications, and backups.

Instagram Picture Deletion: What does it entail?
When a photo gets deleted on Instagram, that does not mean that content is erased suddenly and forever. Instead, Instagram allows something like a cooling-off period whereby, through mechanisms like the "Recently Deleted" folder, one can recover their content. But if a person fails to recover his picture within that time limit, it might get deleted forever.

## **Transient vs. Enduring Erasure**

Temporarily delete: The photo is moved into a "Recently Deleted" folder pending deletion after some time, usually 30 days.
- Deleted forever: Photos are removed from Instagram's servers and are irretrievable without backups or specialized tools.
Understanding this process is essential when deciding which particular recovery method to use.
